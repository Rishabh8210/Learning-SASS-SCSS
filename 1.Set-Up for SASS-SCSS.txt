1.Set-Up for SASS/SCSS (For Windows user)

--Download and Install Node JS
--Usefull Keywords:-
i. node -v -> Use to check Node JS version. 
ii. cd (address) -> Use to change the Directory.
iii. mkdir (Filename) -> Use to create a Folder.
iv. npm init -> Whenever you want to install any package manager. so, we need to define the use of that package, so that's why we use this command.
v. cntrl + c -> to stop the process.

2.Steps after installing Node JS.

-First Run and check that Node JS installed successfully
 use command -> node -v
-Now create and set the Directory where you want to run or create project.
 use command -> cd, mkdir
-Now Initilize the Node Package Manager (npm), he can ask few Ques like package name, version, description, entry point, test command, git repository, keywords, author, licence

-After using (npm init) a package.json file created in that folder and all the provided data is stored in that file.

-Now install SASS in that folder
 use command -> node-sass --save-dev
	--save-dev -> because browser doe's not understand SASS, we are using SASS for our own use.
Note:- Browser only understand plane CSS

After using (node-sass --save-dev), it will take some time to install SASS on your current folder.

-Now set the path of SASS and CSS to the package.json
	i. Open package.json file and write 
	   "compile:sass":"node-sass SCSS_folder_path CSS_folder_path"
	   here,
		SCSS_folder_path used as input file CSS
		CSS_folder_path used as output file CSS	
Note :- you need to write SASS in the SCSS_file then after compiling, it will generate CSS code and write on the output css file automatically.

-Now we need to compile the SCSS file to convert SCSS code to CSS
 use command -> npm run compile:sass

Note:- Compile every time whenever you edit the scss file.

-Trick :- If you want to compile automatically whenever you save the scss file.
	i. Open package.json file and write (-w) at the end it means watch every time whenever we save just 	   compile that file.
	   "compile:sass":"node-sass SCSS_folder_path CSS_folder_path -w"
	it will automatically compile your scss file whenever you save the scss file.
